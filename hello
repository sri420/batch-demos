By default, AWS Glue cannot access resources
--Other AWS Services like 
   S3,
   DynamoDB etc

--Resources within VPC like
    AWS Document DB Cluster
    RDS Instance
    Self-hosted DB in EC2 like Mongodb/MySQL and so on.

--Resources Outside AWS
    On-premises data center connected to AWS via DirectConnect/VPN as well as
    Public internet resources.


AWS Glue needs ENIs in a private subnet of the VPC to connect to,
 VPC resources and other resources outside AWS
 In addition, for resources outside AWS like public internet resource , it needs
 NAT Gateway with EIP

Provides network connectivity for AWS Glue through your VPC.



ENI is a Private IP Address in a private subnet which is used to communiate with,
--VPC resources and also
--Resources in the on-premises environment when connected via DirectConnect/VPN.
--Public resources using NAT Gateway and EIP.

For other AWS Services like S3,DynamoDB etc which might be outside the VPC but within AWS Cloud,
it needs proper role/policy/permissions to access them.



VPC Level Routing for accessing resourcs in same or different subnet.
VPC Peering for accessing resources in differnet VPC within same or different region .

S3 Access is needed for,
    Storing ETL scripts,
    temporary files

S3 VPC Endpoints provide access to S3.




Glue Connection
    Creates a ENI in a private subnet with a private IP address

Glue Crawler
     Catalogs data sources and creates DB/Table metadata objects.

Glue Database/Tables
    Metadata objects  for the crawled resources created by Glue Crawler

Glue Job
`  References the Glue Connection/Glue DB/Tables to access resources 
    (i)   Within VPC,
    (ii)  Outside AWS ,but connected to AWS via DirectConnect/VPN
    (iii) Public internet resources  (via NAT Gateway with EIP)


For on-premises resources connected to AWS Cloud via VPN/DirectConnect , 
(i) Firewall settings needs to be created , if required to allow inbound/outbound access to ENI private 
    subnet in VPC.

(ii) VPC private subnet ENI should  have access to on-premise IP Addresses/Ports.



AWS Glue needs to communicate with its components.
We specify a SG with a self-referencing inbound rule for all TCP ports.
SG is attached to the ENI in the private subnet.
Provides communication between ENIs within a VPC/subnet and prevents incoming network access from
other unspecified sources.

By default, SG allows for all outbound traffic and is minimum required for AWS Glue.

We can restrict outbound rules, to just the destinations where the on-premises database is running.


Firewall Ports
==============
Modify on-premises firewall settings and allow incoming connections from ,
the private subnet that you selected for the connection.
